        <p>
          this is poorman's bear market website. If you see a website that's "fancier" than this and you think to yourself, 
          "why this website fancier than poorman's?" just know poorman don't spend money he don't have on fancy javascript knick-knacks.
          it's a bear market, there is no money, there is no time for javascript knick-knacks. 
          if you see a fancy javascript website, it's probably a scam.
