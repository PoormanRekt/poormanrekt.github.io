          This is a bear market website. No one has any money. If you see a website that's "fancier" than this and you think to yourself, 
          "why this website more fancier than poorman's?" than you deserve to be poor. 
          Poorman don't spend money he don't have on fancy javascript knick knacks and neither should you.
          It's a bear market, there is no money, there is no time for javascript knick knacks. 
          If you see a fancy javascript website, know that it's a scam.
