        <p>This is a bear market website. No one has any money. If you see a website that is "facnier" than this and you think to yourself, 
          "Why this website more fancier than poorman website?" than you deserve to be poor. Poorman don't spend money he doesn't have on fancy knick knacks and neither should you.
           It's a bear market, there is no money. If you see a fancier website know that it is a scam.
